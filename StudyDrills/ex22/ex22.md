REVISION

WHAT DO YOU KNOW  SO FAR?

There won’t be any code in this exercise, so there’s no What You Sh
ould See or Study Drills either. In fact,
this exercise is like one giant Study Drills. I’m going to have you
do a review of what you have learnedso far.
First, go back through every exercise you have done so far and writ
e down every word and symbol(another name for ”character”) that you
have used. Make sure your list of symbols is complete.Next to each 
word or symbol, write its name and what it does. If you can’t find a
name for a symbol in
this book, then look for it online. If you do not know what a word o
r symbol does, then read about it again and try using it in some code.
You may run into a few things you can’t find out or know, so just ke
p those on the list and be ready to
look them up when you find them.
Once you have your list, spend a few days rewriting the list and do
uble-checking that it’s correct. This
may get boring, but push through and really nail it down.
Once you have memorized the list and what they do, then step it up b
y writing out tables of symbols,
their names, and what they do from memory. If you hit some you can’
t recall from memory, go backand memorize them again.

WARNING! The most important thing when doing this exercise is: ”The
re is no failurer only trying."

What You Are Learning

It’s important when you are doing a boring, mindless memorization e
xercise like this to know why. It
helps you focus on a goal and know the purpose of all your efforts.
In this exercise you are learning the names of symbols so that you 
can read source code more easily.
It’s similar to learning the alphabet and basic words of English, e
xcept this Python alphabet has extra
symbols you might not know.
Just take it slow and do not hurt your brain. It’s best to take 15 
minutes at a time with your list and then
take a break. Giving your brain a rest will help you learn faster w
ith less frustration.
